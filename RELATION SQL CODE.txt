What you describe sounds like a "many to many" relationship. One order can hold many products but one product can be part of many rows as well.

For this you can create a table orders (in which additional info may be stored, eg. the userid it belongs to) and have your products table as well.

Now you connect them via something like this

CREATE TABLE order_products (
    orderid INT NOT NULL,
    productid INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (orderid, productid),
    FOREIGN KEY (orderid) REFERENCES orders (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (productid) REFERENCES products (id)
);
